title: Type Checking Geomlab
author: Ashok Menon
abstract: |
  GeomLab is a dynamically typed, functional programming language, primarily
  used for teaching purposes. In this project we aim to capture the typing rules
  that arise from programming in this and other similar languages in a formal
  specification that can be verified statically. To this end, we build on a type
  system in the style of Hindley and Milner, the likes of which may be seen in
  use in languages such as OCaml and (in part) Haskell.
