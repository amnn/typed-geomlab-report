title: Type Checking Geomlab
author: Ashok Menon
abstract: |
  GeomLab is a dynamically typed, functional programming language, primarily
  used for teaching purposes. In this project we aim to capture the typing rules
  that arise from programming in this language in a formal specification that
  can be verified statically. To this end, we build on a type system in the
  style of Hindley and Milner, the likes of which may be seen in use in
  languages such as OCaml and (in part) Haskell.
